>[!quote] *Getting organized is a sign of self respect*

This is where I will be storing all of my notes for the upcoming school year and beyond. Read about what I'm doing [[personal/now |now]] or jump into onw of the entry points below.

[[school/index.md |School Home]]

[[personal/index.md |Personal Home]]

[[personal/reading-list |Reading List]]

Each note is deliberately placed in this [[personal/digital-gardening |digital garden]] in order to keep it both easily accessible and organized. All navigation can be done via the links in the middle of each page, and by using the sidebar on the left. 

Do what you will with these writings, they are mostly for my own usage.
