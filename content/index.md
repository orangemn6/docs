>[!quote] *Getting organized is a sign of self respect*

This is where I will be storing all of my notes for the upcoming school year and beyond.  

[[school/index.md |School Home]]

[[personal/index.md |Personal Home]]

Each note is deliberately placed in this [[personal/digital-gardening |digital garden]] in order to keep it both easily accessible and organized. All navigation can be done via the links in the middle of each page, and by using the sidebar on the left. 

I have 2 different note-taking workflows which are utilized in this website. For subjects like history, I directly take notes into this site's files and organize them with tags and links. For biology and math, I use [ChatGPT](personal/chatgpt.md) to help aid in turning teacher-given materials into studyable notes. You can read more about how I take notes [[personal/notetaking.md |here]]. Things I want to save to read later are [[personal/saved/index.md|here]].  

Do what you will with these writings, they are mostly for my own usage.
