>[!quote] *Getting organized is a sign of self respect*

This is where I will be storing all of my notes for the upcoming school year and beyond. Read about what I'm doing [[personal/now |now]] or jump into one of the entry points below.

[[school/index.md |School Home]]

[[personal/index.md |Personal Home]]

Each note is deliberately placed in this [[personal/digital-gardening |digital garden]] in order to keep it both easily accessible and organized. All navigation can be done via the links in the middle of each page, and by using the sidebar on the left. 

You can read about how I take notes [[personal/notetaking.md |here]]. Things I want to save to read later are [[personal/saved/index.md|here]].  

Do what you will with these writings, they are mostly for my own usage. I keep my personal daily notes under the tag #daily
