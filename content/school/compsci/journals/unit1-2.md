*What are you excited to learn about in this class?*

I am excited to learn more about how computers work, and what skills I can apply computer science to outside of school. I am also excited to get better at coding and use those logic skills in math and science classes.

*What is your definition of information?*

Information is things that you know and are stored.

2 Answers: Is it on the left or the right?

4: Is it left, right, forward or back

We don’t need to change our system until 11

8: sushi, pizza, ice cream, apples, cheeseburger, watermelon, chicken, jello

*Think about the 2 option device. How could you have modified your hand signals?*

You could have modified the hand signals to make each signal less specific, but add more commands. For example, first half, second half, second quarter, and then narrow it down to the last option.

*How many ways can you represent 7?*

Holding up 7 fingers, siete, 3+4, 1+6, sept, 7 tally marks, 7 dots, 5+2, 8-1, 7, seven

Challenge 1: Patterns

Record all of the possible three place value patterns that use only the circle and square shapes. A few are listed in the diagram to the right.

Try to make sure these patterns are in some type of order and avoid putting down patterns randomly

1) circle circle circle

2) circle circle square

3) circle square circle

4) square circle circle

5) square square square

6) square square circle

7) square circle square

8) circle square square

0+1+0+0+16+0+0+0=17

2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4=31

0000 0011 - 7

0001 0100 - 20

**Compression:**

1. It is a good idea to use lossless compression when you need the exact data of a file when it is decompressed.
2. You should use lossy compression when space needs to be saved through storage and when the quality doesn’t matter as much.
3. The important factors when deciding between lossy and lossless are the amount of space that can be taken up in storage and how good the quality of the data needs to be.

IP

Milly Rock’s dance was stolen by Epic Games and sold.

Milly’s dance was digitized

The goal of digitizing it was to sell it to players

Milly is being harmed because his intellectual property was being sold without his permission

These impacts are intended because Epic Games purposely released it under a different name and with no music, trying to avoid a copyright infringement.

**How do people share data in the real world?**

Upload it to the internet, share it with friends or family or other people on the internet, fans of their content t

**What are the issues with this internet setup?**

- There is only one wire, if it breaks there is no connectivity
- Only one person can communicate with one other person, you need to disconnect to connect with someone else
- If the singular connection is broken, if a message hasn’t been fully sent it will be destroyed.

Create a square with one in the middle,

**Speed and Accuracy**

Quick and Accurate: Doing a test

Quick and Accurate: Doing homework

Accurate: doctor doing surgery

Quick: morning routine

Packets: Small pieces of broken up data

TCP reorders packets and makes sure they are there and in order

Contains IP address and metadata

Redundancy from routers makes internet more reliable

Lev: 6.34

Chris: 29.121

Maxi: 9.80

Joey: 80.221

Rayan: 14.62

Jitkis 88.97

Ethan: 67.39

Sophia 97.13

DNS maps domain names into ip addresses even if they change

This helps the internet scale because even when ip addresses are changing, there is still an address to send data to

Each router does not need to know every single address

Used addresses are saved

HTTP is the language used for the computer to talk with another computer to ask for a document or data

Get requests are the word get and the document being requested

- > GET /login to load a login page

HTML is used to tell a browser how to make a page look

HTML is broken down into http requests

SSL TLS and HTTPS are necessary to make sure that whoever is sending the data is actually who they say they are.

- > SSL and TLS are the secure channels that protect your communications from snooping and tampering

SSL/TLS certs are verified documents that show a website is verified, authorities make sure that only verified websites can connect to your computer.
