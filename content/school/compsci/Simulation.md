## Simulation
A simulation is a computational model used to replicate and study real-world phenomena. Simulations are essential tools in fields like science, engineering, and business.

### Characteristics of Simulations:
- Use [[abstraction]] to focus on key variables while ignoring minor details.
- Analyze the effects of different conditions without physical risks or costs.
- Often require large datasets and advanced [[algorithms]].

### Real-World Applications:
- Predicting weather patterns using [[big data]].
- Modeling traffic flow to optimize urban planning.
- Simulating disease spread to inform public health policies.
