## Digital Media
Digital media refers to content created and distributed through digital platforms, including images, videos, music, and interactive apps.

### Representation of Digital Media:
- **Images**: Stored as grids of pixels, each with color codes.
- **Videos**: Sequences of image frames with synchronized audio.
- **Audio**: Sampled waveforms encoded in formats like MP3 or WAV.

### Compression:
To save space and enable faster transmission over [[the Internet]], digital media is often compressed:
- **Lossy Compression**: Reduces file size by discarding some [[Data]] (e.g., JPEG, MP3).
- **Lossless Compression**: Retains all original [[Data]] (e.g., PNG, FLAC).

### Ethical Concerns:
- Copyright violations and piracy.
- Misinformation and deepfakes created using [[programming]] tools.
- Accessibility of digital content to all users.
