## Data
Data consists of raw facts and figures that can be processed by computers to extract meaningful information.

### Types of Data:
- **Quantitative**: Numerical values (e.g., temperature readings, test scores).
- **Qualitative**: Descriptive values (e.g., colors, opinions).

### Data Representation:
- All [[data]] is represented in binary (0s and 1s). For example:
  - Text uses character encodings like ASCII or Unicode.
  - Images are stored as grids of pixels with RGB color codes.
  - Audio and video are represented as waveforms sampled at regular intervals.

### Cleaning and Transforming Data:
- Removing duplicates or errors.
- Converting formats for compatibility.
- Normalizing values for consistency, especially in [[big data]] projects.

### Data Analysis:
- Identifying trends through sorting, filtering, and statistical analysis.
- Visualizing results with charts and graphs to support decision-making.

### Ethical Considerations:
- Privacy and security of [[data]] in storage and transit.
- Bias in [[Algorithms]] processing [[data]].
- Laws like GDPR and HIPAA governing [[data]] use.
