## Computational Thinking
Computational thinking is the process of approaching problems in a way that computers can understand and solve.

### Key Components:
- **Decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. This is essential in designing [[algorithms]].
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends or repeated processes in [[data]].
- **[[Abstraction]]**: Simplifying problems by focusing only on relevant details, a crucial step in designing efficient [[programming]] solutions.
- **Algorithm Design**: Creating step-by-step instructions to solve a problem, which forms the basis of [[programming]].

### Application of Computational Thinking:
- Used in [[data]] analysis to extract useful information.
- Essential for designing secure systems in [[cybersecurity]].
- Helps improve efficiency in [[big data]] processing.
