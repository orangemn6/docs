## Problem-Solving Process
Problem-solving in computer science involves systematically addressing challenges using a structured approach.

### Steps in Problem-Solving:
1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly understand the issue.
2. **Plan a Solution**: Use [[computational thinking]] to break it into parts.
3. **Design an Algorithm**: Create a step-by-step plan to solve the problem.
4. **Implement the Algorithm**: Translate the solution into [[programming]] code.
5. **Test and Evaluate**: Verify the solution works under various conditions.
6. **Iterate**: Refine the solution based on feedback and testing.
