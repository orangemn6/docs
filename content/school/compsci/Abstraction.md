## Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of reducing complexity by focusing on the main idea and ignoring unnecessary details. It is a critical concept in all aspects of computer science, from [[algorithms]] to [[programming]].

### Examples of Abstraction:
- **[[Programming]]**: Using functions or libraries to hide complex logic.
- **Networking**: IP addresses abstract physical device locations on [[the Internet]].
- **[[Data]]**: Representing an image as a matrix of numbers instead of individual pixels.

### Benefits of Abstraction:
- Simplifies problem-solving by reducing details.
- Promotes reusability and modularity in [[programming]].
- Makes systems easier to understand, design, and troubleshoot.
