## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are subsets of computer science focused on creating systems that learn and make decisions.

### Key Concepts:
- **AI**: Simulating human intelligence through [[algorithms]].
- **ML**: Training models using [[data]] to recognize patterns and make predictions.
- **Neural Networks**: Mimic the structure of the human brain to solve complex problems.

### Applications of AI/ML:
- Self-driving cars using real-time [[data]] analysis.
- Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa.
- Predictive analytics in [[big data]].

### Ethical Challenges:
- Bias in [[data]] used to train models.
- Job displacement due to automation.
- Balancing innovation with accountability in decision-making systems.
