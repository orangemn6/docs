## Algorithms
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. It forms the foundation of [[programming]] and is critical in [[Computational Thinking]].

### Key Characteristics:
- **Efficiency**: How quickly and effectively an algorithm solves a problem, measured using Big-O notation.
- **Correctness**: Producing accurate outputs for all valid inputs.
- **Clarity**: Readable and maintainable for collaboration.

### Designing Algorithms:
- Use [[computational thinking]] principles like decomposition and [[Abstraction]].
- Incorporate patterns identified in [[data]].
- Test algorithms with a variety of inputs to ensure correctness.

### Real-World Applications:
- Sorting large datasets in [[big data]] analysis.
- Encrypting information for [[cybersecurity]].
- Routing [[Data]] packets across [[the Internet]].
