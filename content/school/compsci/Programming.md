## Programming
Programming involves implementing [[algorithms]] in a language that a computer can execute.

### Fundamentals:
- **Variables**: Store and manipulate [[data]].
- **Conditionals**: Allow decision-making based on logical expressions.
- **Loops**: Enable repeated actions, often iterating over datasets.
- **Functions**: Modularize code by encapsulating logic for reuse.

### Debugging:
- Identifying and fixing syntax, runtime, and logic errors.
- Techniques include printing variable states, testing edge cases, and using debugging tools.

### Advanced Concepts:
- **[[Abstraction]]**: Encapsulating complexity, such as through object-oriented programming.
- **Efficiency**: Writing code that minimizes time and space complexity, directly tied to [[algorithms]].
- **Collaboration**: Leveraging version control systems for team projects, as seen in real-world software development.
