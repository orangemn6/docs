### Brutus’ Complaints About the Federal Government under Articles I and II

Brutus, in **Letter XVI (April 10, 1788)**, criticized the Constitution for granting Congress excessive powers under Article I, particularly the ability to tax, regulate commerce, and maintain a standing army, which he believed would undermine state authority and individual freedoms. He argued that these broad powers would lead to an overbearing federal government capable of subjugating the states and concentrating power in the hands of a few elites. Similarly, in **“John Dewitt” Letter III (November 5, 1787)**, concerns were raised about the presidency under Article II, which was seen as dangerously monarchical due to powers like the veto, military command, and treaty-making. Both writers feared that the combination of expansive legislative and executive powers would erode democracy and concentrate unchecked authority at the federal level.

### How the Founders Ensured Political and Economic Power Remained with the Elite

The Constitution ensured the retention of political and economic power by the elite through deliberate structures. Politically, the **Senate** was designed to be insulated from direct democratic influence, with state legislatures selecting senators, favoring wealthy and influential individuals. The **Electoral College**, similarly, placed presidential elections in the hands of appointed electors, giving disproportionate power to politically connected elites. Economically, the **Commerce Clause** allowed Congress to regulate trade, benefiting wealthy merchants and industrialists by ensuring consistent national policies. Additionally, the **Contracts Clause** prohibited states from interfering with private contracts, protecting creditors and property owners from populist efforts like debt relief, thereby safeguarding elite economic interests. These mechanisms ensured that political and economic power remained concentrated in the hands of those with wealth and influence.

### How Donald Trump Won the 2024 Presidential Election

Donald Trump’s 2024 victory resulted from a focused campaign strategy, favorable political conditions, and his emphasis on issues that resonated with voters. His campaign prioritized economic recovery, combating inflation, and stricter immigration policies, which appealed to working-class voters in battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Trump also harnessed cultural issues, such as opposition to progressive policies on education and gender identity, to energize his conservative base. His strategy included massive rallies, targeted social media campaigns, and direct appeals to voter discontent with the Biden administration’s economic performance. Deep political polarization worked in Trump’s favor as he consolidated Republican support while benefiting from Democratic divisions, ensuring high voter turnout among his base. By framing himself as an outsider fighting for the average American against the establishment, Trump solidified his appeal and secured his victory.

### Provisions Made by the Constitutional Convention to Protect Less Populous States

The Constitutional Convention ensured protections for less populous states by granting them equal representation in the Senate and creating the Electoral College. Under the Great Compromise, each state, regardless of population, received two senators, giving smaller states equal legislative power in the Senate compared to larger states. The Electoral College also gave smaller states greater influence in presidential elections by allocating electors based on the total number of representatives and senators, ensuring that their voices mattered despite their smaller populations. These measures balanced the interests of states of varying sizes, preventing larger states from dominating the federal government and encouraging national unity.
