1. Donald Trump’s Victory in the 2024 Presidential Election

  

Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 Presidential Election was a result of a combination of strategic campaigning, key issues resonating with voters, and shifting political forces.

  

Campaign Strategy

  

Trump employed a grassroots-driven approach combined with a significant digital campaign that targeted key battleground states. His strategy relied heavily on rallies to energize his base and social media to amplify his message. He prioritized voter outreach in traditionally blue states, hoping to flip certain regions with targeted messaging about economic revival and crime reduction.

  

Key Issues of the Race

• Economic Concerns: With inflation continuing to be a concern in the 2024 election cycle, Trump’s campaign emphasized reducing government spending and tax cuts to appeal to middle-class voters.

• Immigration and Border Security: Trump revisited his 2016 campaign rhetoric, promising stricter immigration policies.

• Cultural Issues: The campaign also focused on issues like free speech, “woke” policies in education, and public safety, appealing to a broader conservative audience.

  

Political Forces

• Division in the Democratic Party: Internal disputes within the Democratic Party weakened their cohesion.

• Third-Party Influence: Increased third-party participation, particularly from candidates advocating moderate policies, siphoned votes from his opponents.

• Strong Grassroots Turnout: His campaign successfully mobilized voters in rural and suburban areas, critical to his electoral college win.

  

2. Provisions Made by the Constitutional Convention to Protect Less Populous States

  

The framers at the Constitutional Convention implemented several measures to ensure smaller states retained influence in the new government:

• Equal Representation in the Senate: Every state, regardless of population, was granted two senators. This provided less populous states equal legislative power in the Senate compared to larger states.

• Electoral College System: Each state’s electoral votes were based on their total representation in Congress (House + Senate). This gave smaller states disproportionate influence in presidential elections.

• Amendment Process: The process to amend the Constitution required the consent of three-fourths of the states, preventing larger states from unilaterally imposing changes on smaller ones.

  

3. Brutus’s Complaints About the Federal Government (Articles I and II)

  

Brutus (Anti-Federalist) expressed significant concerns about the federal government outlined in the Constitution:

• Consolidation of Power: He believed that Article I gave Congress too much authority, particularly with the “necessary and proper” and “supremacy” clauses, which could lead to federal overreach.

• Presidential Power: In Article II, Brutus argued that the executive branch held excessive power, particularly in its ability to command the military and veto legislation, which he feared could evolve into a monarchy.

• Representation: He criticized the size of Congressional representation, suggesting it was too small to adequately represent diverse interests, potentially leading to an elite ruling class.

  

4. Retention of Political and Economic Power in the 1787 Constitution

  

Political Power

• Senate Structure: Senators were originally selected by state legislatures, ensuring that state elites controlled a powerful branch of government.

• Electoral College: The system for selecting the president favored the influence of the political elite, as electors were chosen through mechanisms often controlled by the upper classes.

  

Economic Power

• Protection of Property Rights: The Constitution emphasized property protections, benefiting landowners and creditors. For example, Article I, Section 10 prohibited states from passing laws that impaired contracts.

• Three-Fifths Compromise: This compromise inflated the political power of slave-holding states, which were economically reliant on slavery, by increasing their representation in the House of Representatives.

  

These provisions entrenched the influence of the politically and economically powerful by aligning governmental systems to their interests, ensuring their continued dominance in the early United States.
