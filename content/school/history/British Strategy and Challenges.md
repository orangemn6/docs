## British Strategy and Challenges
- **City Captures**: The British had little trouble capturing cities since most were on the coast, allowing the British navy to provide support.
- **Challenges**:
  - Did not want to kill their colonial subjects.
  - Burdened by heavy debt from the French and Indian War.
  - Economic impact from colonial non-importation agreements made the war effort costly.
