| Donald Trump won the 2024 Presidential Election through a combination of targeted campaign strategies, focus on key issues, and favorable political forces. His campaign emphasized outreach to working-class voters, utilizing populist messaging to resonate with concerns about inflation, immigration, and crime. He relied heavily on social media to bypass traditional media outlets and targeted swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Key issues in the race included economic growth, border security, and concerns about urban safety, which aligned with his messaging. Political forces like partisan polarization and demographic shifts further contributed to his victory, alongside a divided opposition and strategic turnout in battleground states.                                                                                                                                     |

| The Constitutional Convention included several provisions to protect less populous states. The Great Compromise created a bicameral legislature, where the Senate provided equal representation for all states, regardless of size, while the House of Representatives was based on population. The Electoral College ensured that smaller states had a disproportionate influence in presidential elections. Additionally, clauses like the Commerce Clause protected states' rights in trade matters, and the three-fifths compromise balanced representation by including enslaved populations partially in calculations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Brutus’s concerns centered on the excessive power granted to the federal government under Articles I and II. He criticized the broad taxation authority of Congress (Article I, Section 8), fearing it would diminish state sovereignty. Brutus also expressed alarm over the unilateral powers of the executive, such as control over the military and veto authority (Article II), which he believed could lead to an unchecked central authority and potential tyranny.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| The 1787 Constitution safeguarded the power of political and economic elites through mechanisms like the Senate, which allowed state legislatures to appoint senators, and the Electoral College, which empowered elites to influence presidential elections. Economically, the Constitution protected property rights and required Congressional approval for taxation, ensuring that economic elites maintained control over financial matters. These provisions were designed to prevent excessive democratic influence and ensure stability in governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Our affairs seem to lead to some crisis—some Revolution—something that I cannot foresee, or conjecture. I am uneasy and apprehensive—more so, than during the War—*Then* we had a fixed Object, and tho the means and time of attaining it were often problematical, yet I did firmly believe that we should ultimately succeed, because I was convinced that Justice was with us. The Case is now altered—we are going and doing wrong, and therefore I look forward to Evils and Calamities, but without being able to guess at the Instrument nature or measure of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| IT HAS been already observed that the federal government ought to possess the power of providing for the support of the national forces; in which proposition was intended to be included the expense of raising troops, of building and equipping fleets, and all other expenses in any wise connected with military arrangements and operations. But these are not the only objects to which the jurisdiction of the Union, in respect to revenue, must necessarily be empowered to extend. It must embrace a provision for the support of the national civil list; for the payment of the national debts contracted, or that may be contracted; and, in general, for all those matters which will call for disbursements out of the national treasury.                                                                                                                                                                         |

| The great art, therefore, in forming a good constitution, appears to be this, so to frame it, as that those to whom the power is committed shall be subject to the same feelings, and aim at the same objects as the people do, who transfer to them their authority. There is no possible way to effect this but by an equal, full and fair representation; this, therefore, is the great desideratum in politics. However fair an appearance any government may make, though it may possess a thousand plausible articles and be decorated with ever so many ornaments, yet if it is deficient in this essential principle of a full and just representation of the people, it will be only like a painted sepulcher—For, without this it cannot be a free government; let the administration of it be good or ill, it still will be a government, not according to the will of the people, but according to the will of a few. |
