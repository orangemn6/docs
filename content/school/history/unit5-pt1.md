## Problems under the Articles

#### Domestic:

- **Western land claims:** Congress did not have the power to govern anything past the 13 colonies even though people lived there and it was claimed by the states.
- Continental currency was inflated, **Congress could not tax**
- Renewed trade with Britain led to a flood of cheap British goods, which Congress had no power to regulate and put American businesses out of business
- Economic recession exacerbated by Congress's *inability to make regulations on economic matters*
- **Land ordinance of 1785:** Reveals what America values and what Congress wants to push on the states. 
- **Congress has no power, receives no respect from the states**
#### International:
- *British* forces continue to occupy frontier posts
- Border dispute leads to *Spain* closing off **port of New Orleans**
	- Americans in the northwest are unable to send goods down to New Orleans, and thus anywhere else.
