## FRQ

**How does the Articles of Confederation provide the answer to what the Declaration of Independence argues is the American idea of a good government? Tell what the concept of a good government is and how the articles carves it out.**

The Declaration of Independence defines a "good government" as one deriving its just powers from the consent of the governed and securing the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Articles of Confederation, adopted during the Revolution, reflect this philosophy by emphasizing limited centralized authority and safeguarding the autonomy of the individual states. Rooted in a deep distrust of tyranny, the Articles granted Congress authority over collective matters like war, diplomacy, and trade but left most powers to state governments, ensuring they retained sovereignty. This decentralized system embodied the ideal of a government close to the people and responsive to their needs. However, the Articles also revealed the challenges of this framework, such as the lack of enforcement power for federal laws or taxation, showing that while the concept prioritized liberty and self-governance, its execution proved insufficient for maintaining national unity.


**Describe in detail the extent to which the institution of slavery played a role in the American Revolution**

Slavery played a complex and significant role in the American Revolution, shaping political, social, and economic dynamics. Many enslaved individuals sought freedom by taking advantage of the conflict, with thousands escaping bondage or joining British forces after the Crown promised emancipation to those who fought for them. This intensified debates over liberty and equality, exposing contradictions in the rhetoric of freedom used by white revolutionaries who often defended slavery as an economic necessity. Southern colonies, in particular, were deeply invested in slavery and feared that British policies, such as Lord Dunmore’s Proclamation, might undermine the institution. Conversely, the Revolution spurred some Northern states to reevaluate slavery, leading to gradual emancipation laws. While the ideals of the Revolution highlighted the tension between liberty and slavery, the institution persisted, embedded in the new nation’s foundations and exacerbating sectional divisions that would eventually lead to future conflicts.

**Use the following source to answer the question:**

*Who was Cincinnatus? A well-respected soldier and landowner from the patrician class, he served as consul in 460 BCE and as dictator in 458 and 439. Consuls were the chief military and civil magistrates in the Roman republic; two were elected annually to serve a year-long term. Dictators, on the other hand, were given absolute magistracy during military or domestic crises. Dictators were appointed to accomplish a particular task, usually to lead an army into battle, and were expected to resign once the task was completed.*

*During the reign of Caesar Augustus (63 BCE-14CE), the historians Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus used Cincinnatus in their works as an early model of civic virtue. In 458 BCE, Roman troops led by the consul L. Minucius Esquilinus were under siege by the Aequi tribe on Mount Algidus. According to Livy’s Ab Urbe Condita, Cincinnatus was called from his modest farm and appointed dictator, charged with the task of breaking the siege on Esquilinus. Within a fortnight Cincinnatus had assembled an army, defeated the Aequi and surrendered his office, returning to his farm. Livy contrasted Cincinnatus with the cautionary tale of Appius Claudius, whose reign Livy saw as a historical example of excess and abuse of power.*

**Use the following to answer the next question**

*But have we not enjoyed liberty even under the English monarchy? Shall we this day renounce that to go and seek it in I know not what form of republic, which will soon change into a licentious anarchy and popular tyranny?  In the human body the head only sustains and governs all the members, directing them, with admirable harmony, to the same object, which is self-preservation and happiness; so the head of the body politic, that is the king, in concert with the Parliament, can alone maintain the union of the members of this Empire, lately so flourishing, and prevent civil war by obviating all the evils produced by variety of opinions and diversity of interests.  And so firm is my persuasion of this that I fully believe the most cruel war which Great Britain could make upon us would be that of not making any; and that the surest means of bring us back to her obedience would be that of employing none.  For the dread of the English arms, once removed, provinces would rise up against  provinces and cities against cities; and we shall be seen to turn against ourselves the arms we have taken up to combat the common enemy. Insurmountable necessity would then compel us to resort to the tutelary authority which we should have rashly abjured, and, if it consented to receive us again under its aegis, it would be no longer as free citizens but as slaves.  Still inexperienced and in our infancy, what proof have we given of our ability to walk without a guide?*
