## Reduction Phase of Calvin Cycle  
In the reduction phase of the [[Calvin Cycle]], ATP and [[NADPH]] are used to convert 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). ATP provides the [[energy]] for [[Phosphorylation]], while [[NADPH]] donates electrons for the reduction of the intermediate molecule. G3P is a three-carbon sugar that serves as the primary output of the cycle and a precursor for [[Glucose]] synthesis.
