## Lumen  
The lumen refers to the inner fluid-filled space of a [[Thylakoid]] in the [[Chloroplast]]. It plays a key role in the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] of [[Photosynthesis]], particularly in the generation of a [[Proton Gradient]] that drives the synthesis of ATP.  

- **Role in [[Photophosphorylation]]**: During the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]], as electrons travel through the [[Electron Transport Chain]] (ETC), protons (H+) are pumped from the [[Stroma]] into the lumen. This builds a high concentration of protons in the lumen compared to the stroma, creating an electrochemical gradient. The potential [[energy]] in this gradient is used by [[ATP Synthase]] to produce [[ATP]] as protons flow back into the stroma.  

- **[[Photolysis]]**: In [[Photosystem II]], the splitting of water molecules ([[Photolysis]]) occurs in the lumen. Water is broken down into oxygen, protons, and electrons. The electrons replenish those lost by PSII, and the protons contribute to the proton gradient across the [[Thylakoid]] membrane. Oxygen is released as a byproduct.  

The lumen's role in establishing proton gradients is essential for the efficient production of ATP and [[NADPH]], which are used in the [[Calvin Cycle]] to synthesize sugars.
