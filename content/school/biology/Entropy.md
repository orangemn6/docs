## Entropy  
[[Entropy]] measures the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. Biological systems constantly fight entropy by investing [[energy]] to build and maintain order. For example, during [[Photosynthesis]], plants use light [[energy]] to create highly organized [[Glucose]] molecules from carbon dioxide and water. This fight against entropy is a defining feature of living organisms.
