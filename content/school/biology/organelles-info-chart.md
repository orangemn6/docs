## Cell Organelles
>[!info] Organelles are structures within the cytoplasm of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that perform specific functions


|   |  |  |  |
| :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Structure | Description | Primary Function(s)  | Found in which cells? |
| Cell Wall  | Rigid, protective outer layer  Made up of CELLULOSE (fiber), a carbohydrate | Provide support and protection for the cell   | PLANTS  BACTERIA |
| Cell Membrane  | Flexible, thin outer layer surrounding the cytoplasm of a cell  Made up of phospho**lipids** | Allow substances in/out of the cell  Encloses the cell  | PLANTS  ANIMALS BACTERIA  |
| Cytoplasm  | Area inside the membrane where all organelles are found Made up of cytosol \- jelly-like fluid (mostly water)  | Hold organelles  Contain nutrients to be used by organelles | PLANTS  ANIMALS BACTERIA  |
| Cytoskeleton | Physical framework of the cell  Made up of microtubules & microfilaments, protein fibers that form a “skeleton” for the cell  Kind of like bridge with many strings holding it up | Helps cell maintain its shape, allows for cell and organelle movement  | PLANTS  ANIMALS BACTERIA |
|  |  |  |  |
| Nucleus | Control center of the cell  Made up of:  Nuclear envelope \- membrane containing NUCLEAR PORES \- openings that allow substances to move in/out of the nucleus  Nucleolus \- produces **ribosomes**  | Contains DNA (regulates gene expression)  Controls which proteins the cell makes  | PLANTS  ANIMALS  |
| Large Central Vacuole | Large membrane-bound sac  Can take up to 80% of the cell  | Store water Helps plant maintain its structure Used in endo & exocitosis Empty vacuole \= deflated cell  | PLANTS |
| Chloroplasts  | Organelle involved in photosynthesis Made up of thylakoids \- structures inside the chloroplast that contain chlorophyll, green pigment molecules that absorb light [[energy.md |energy]]  | Photosynthesis \- the process where plants turn light [[energy.md |energy]] into sugar (food) takes place here  | PLANTS |

## More Cell Organelles (Part II)

| Structure | Description | Primary Function(s)  | Found in which cells? |
| :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Vesicles  | Small membrane bound sacs or vesicles, transport vehicles  | Store food, water, waste Transport things throughout the cell  | **ANIMALS **  |
| Lysosomes  | A specialized vesicle that contains enzymes, proteins that break down macromolecules & old, worn out, broken cell parts  Suicide sac | “Digestive system” of the cell \- digestive enzymes “Clean up” crew  Results in apoptosis \- cell digests itself  | **ANIMALS**  |
| Ribosomes  | Cell’s protein factory DOES NOT have a membrane Found… On nuclear envelope  On rough ER  Floating in the cytoplasm  | build proteins | **PLANTS    ANIMALS  BACTERIA** |
| Mitochondria | Organelle involved in [[energy.md |energy]] production  | Use glucose to produce [[energy.md |energy]] for the cell  The more activity the cell does, mitochondria Make their own DNA Are believed to have been bacteria at one point Make ATP  Reproduce on their own | **PLANTS    ANIMALS**  |
| Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)  | System of 2 parts:  ROUGH ER \- studded with ribosomes, looks like sheets  SMOOTH ER \- no ribosomes, tube-like structures | ROUGH ER \-  Creates and packages proteins SMOOTH ER \- \- Produces lipids and detoxifies drugs/poisons  Alcoholic (people) \- more smooth ER Transports material in a vesicle to golgi body | **PLANTS    ANIMALS**  |
| Golgi Apparatus (Golgi Body)  | Made up of vesicles  Kinda like pita stacked  | Package and transport materials (like macromolecules) throughout the cell  (UPS) Produces lysosomes (a specific type of vesicle)  |  **PLANTS  ANIMALS** |
| Centrioles | Spindle-shaped, 90 degree angle to each other | Help with cell division | **ANIMALS** |
