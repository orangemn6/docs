## Active Site  
The [[Active Site]] is the region on an [[Enzyme]] where the [[Substrate]] binds and the reaction occurs. It is highly specific, shaped to accommodate only certain [[Substrates]] through the [[Induced-Fit Hypothesis]]. Changes to the active site, such as those caused by [[Inhibitors]] or denaturation, can disrupt enzyme activity. Understanding the active site is key to grasping how [[Enzymes]] function and are regulated.
