## Thylakoid  
The [[Thylakoid]] is a disk-shaped membrane structure inside the [[Chloroplast]] where the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] occur. Its membrane contains [[Chlorophyll]] and accessory [[Pigments]] organized into [[Photosystem I]] and [[Photosystem II]]. The thylakoid lumen is the site of [[Photolysis]], where water is split to release oxygen, electrons, and protons. The protons contribute to a [[Proton Gradient]] that drives [[ATP]] production through [[ATP Synthase]].
