## Calvin Cycle  
The [[Calvin Cycle]], also known as the light independent reactions or [[Carbon Fixation]], occurs in the [[Stroma]] of the [[Chloroplast]]. It uses [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]] from the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] to convert carbon dioxide into [[Glucose]]. The cycle has three main stages: [[Carbon Fixation]], reduction, and regeneration of RuBP. The [[Enzymes]] [[RuBisCO]] catalyzes the first step, binding CO2 to RuBP. This cycle produces [[G3P]], a three-carbon sugar that can be used to form [[Glucose]] and other carbohydrates.
