## Proton Gradient  
The [[Proton Gradient]] is a concentration gradient of protons (H‚Å∫ ions) across the [[Thylakoid]] membrane, with a high concentration in the [[Thylakoid Lumen]] and a lower concentration in the [[Stroma]]. This gradient is created by the activity of the [[Electron Transport Chain]], which pumps protons into the lumen. The gradient stores potential [[energy]] that drives the synthesis of ATP through [[ATP Synthase]].
