## Photorespiration  
[[Photorespiration]] occurs when [[RuBisCO]] binds oxygen instead of CO2 during the [[Calvin Cycle]]. This process reduces the efficiency of [[Photosynthesis]] by producing less usable carbon compounds. Photorespiration is more likely to occur in hot, dry environments when plants close their [[Stomata]] to prevent water loss, reducing CO2 availability. Some plants, like [[C4 Plants]] and [[CAM Plants]], have evolved adaptations to minimize photorespiration.
