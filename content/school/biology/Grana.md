## Grana  
Grana are stacks of [[Thylakoid]] located within the [[Chloroplast]], resembling piles of coins. These structures are essential for the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] of [[Photosynthesis]] as they house [[Pigments]] like [[Chlorophyll]] and proteins involved in capturing light energy. The grana maximize the surface area available for light absorption and the operation of the [[Electron Transport Chain]].  

The close arrangement of thylakoids in grana allows for efficient interaction between photosystems and other components necessary for [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]] production. Grana are interconnected by stromal lamellae, thin structures that link stacks and facilitate the distribution of energy across the [[Chloroplast]]. Their structural design is key to optimizing the [[energy]] capture and conversion processes of [[Photosynthesis]].
