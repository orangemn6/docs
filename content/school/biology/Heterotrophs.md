## Heterotroph  
A heterotroph is an organism that obtains its [[energy]] and organic nutrients by consuming other organisms, as it cannot produce its own food. Unlike [[Autotrophs]], heterotrophs depend on organic compounds synthesized by [[Autotrophs]] or other heterotrophs for survival. Animals, fungi, and many bacteria are common examples of heterotrophs.  

Heterotrophs extract energy through processes like [[Cellular Respiration]], where organic molecules such as [[Glucose]], often derived from [[Autotrophs]], are broken down to produce [[ATP]]. This reliance on consuming other organisms for [[energy]] and carbon makes heterotrophs critical in maintaining the flow of energy within ecosystems, as they contribute to the cycling of matter by decomposing organic material and returning nutrients to the environment.
