## Photosystem  
A photosystem is a complex of [[proteins]] and [[Pigments]] found in the [[Thylakoid]] Membrane of [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]] that plays a crucial role in the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] of [[Photosynthesis]]. Photosystems absorb light energy, which is then used to excite electrons, initiating the process of energy conversion into chemical forms. There are two main types of photosystems:  

- **[[Photosystem II]] (PSII)**:  
  - PSII is the first photosystem in the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]]. It absorbs light at a wavelength of 680 nm and excites electrons, which are then passed down the [[Electron Transport Chain]] (ETC).  
  - This process involves the splitting of water molecules ([[Photolysis]]) to replenish the lost electrons, producing [[Oxygen as a Byproduct]]. The energy released during electron transfer helps establish a [[Proton Gradient]] used to generate [[ATP]] through [[Photophosphorylation]].  

- **[[Photosystem I]] (PSI)**:  
  - PSI absorbs light at a wavelength of 700 nm and is responsible for the [[Reduction Phase of Calvin Cycle|reduction]] of NADP+ to [[NADPH]], which is essential for the [[Calvin Cycle]].  
  - The excited electrons from PSI travel through another part of the ETC and are transferred to [[NADP+]], forming NADPH, which provides the reducing power needed for [[Carbon Fixation]] in the dark reactions.  

Together, PSII and PSI work in tandem to convert light energy into ATP and NADPH, which are required for the synthesis of sugars during the [[Calvin Cycle]].
