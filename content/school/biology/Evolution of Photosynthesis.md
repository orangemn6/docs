The [[Evolution of Photosynthesis]] began with ancient cyanobacteria around 3 billion years ago. These organisms introduced oxygen into Earthâ€™s atmosphere through [[Oxygenic Photosynthesis]]. The development of [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]] in plants likely resulted from an ancient symbiotic relationship between a eukaryotic cell and a photosynthetic prokaryote, as explained by the [[Endosymbiotic Theory]].
