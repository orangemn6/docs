## Autotroph  
An autotroph is an organism capable of producing its own food using inorganic substances and an external [[energy]] source. Plants, algae, and certain bacteria are examples of autotrophs that use [[Photosynthesis]] to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in [[Glucose]]. These organisms are primary producers, forming the base of most ecological food chains by supplying energy and organic matter to [[Heterotrophs]].  

Autotrophs can be classified into two main types: **photoautotrophs**, which harness energy from sunlight, and **chemoautotrophs**, which obtain energy through chemical reactions involving inorganic molecules. By fixing carbon dioxide into organic molecules like [[G3P]] during the [[Calvin Cycle]], autotrophs play a vital role in the global carbon cycle and sustain life on Earth.
