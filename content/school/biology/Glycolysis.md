## Glycolysis

Glucose is broken down into 2 [[Pyruvate]], 2ATP created, NADH created  
Occurs in the cytosol of the cell  
2 major phases:

- Energy investment: starts to break the glucose by infusing extra phosphate groups into the ring, energizing it.   
- Energy payoff: Glucose breaks into 2 [[pyruvate]], cell gains lots of energy
