### Glycolysis

*   The first stage begins with glycolysis, the splitting of glucose
    
    *   Glucose is a six-carbon molecule that is broken into two three- carbon molecules called pyruvic acid.
        
    *   This breakdown of glucose also results in the net production of two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH.
        
    *   Glucose + 2 ATP + 2NAD+ â†’ 2 Pyruvic acid + 4 ATP + 2NADH
        
    *   Glycolysis also creates two NADH, which result from the transfer of electrons to the carrier NAD+, which then becomes NADH.
        
    *   NAD+ and NADH are constantly being turned into each other as electrons are being carried and then unloaded.

There are four important tidbits to remember regarding glycolysis:

*   occurs in the cytoplasm
    
*   net of 2 ATPs produced
    
*   2 pyruvic acids formed
    
*   2 NADH produced
