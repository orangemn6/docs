## Overview: Life at the Edge

- **Plasma Membrane**: Boundary separating the living cell from its environment.
  - Exhibits **selective permeability**: Allows certain substances to cross more easily.

## **Concept 7.1**: Fluid Mosaic Model of Membranes

- **Phospholipids**:
  - Most abundant lipid.
  - Amphipathic (hydrophobic tails, hydrophilic heads).
- **Fluid Mosaic Model**:
  - Membrane = Fluid structure with embedded "mosaic" proteins.

### Membrane Models and History

- 1935: **Davson-Danielli model**:
  - Phospholipid bilayer sandwiched by globular proteins.
- 1972: **Singer and Nicolson**:
  - Membrane = Mosaic of proteins within the bilayer.
  - Hydrophilic regions exposed; hydrophobic regions embedded.

### Membrane Fluidity

- **Lipid Movement**:
  - Lateral movement frequent; flip-flopping rare.
- **Temperature Effects**:
  - Cold: Membrane solidifies.
  - Unsaturated fatty acids = Greater fluidity.
- **Cholesterol Role**:
  - At 37°C: Restrains lipid movement.
  - At low temps: Prevents tight packing, maintaining fluidity.

## **Concept 7.2**: Selective Permeability

### Lipid Bilayer Permeability

- **Hydrophobic molecules** (e.g., hydrocarbons): Pass through easily.
- **Polar molecules** (e.g., sugars): Cross slowly or need assistance.

### Transport Proteins

- **Channel Proteins**:
  - Provide hydrophilic tunnels.
  - Example: **Aquaporins** (water transport).
- **Carrier Proteins**:
  - Bind and shuttle molecules via shape changes.
  - Specific to transported substance.

## **Concept 7.3**: Passive Transport

- **Diffusion**:
  - Movement down the concentration gradient without energy use.
  - At equilibrium: Equal movement in both directions.
- **Osmosis**:
  - Diffusion of water across a membrane.
  - Direction: Low to high solute concentration.

### Tonicity and Water Balance

- **Isotonic**: No net water movement.
- **Hypertonic**: Cell loses water.
- **Hypotonic**: Cell gains water.

---

## **Concept 7.4**: Active Transport

- Moves solutes **against** their gradients using **ATP**.
- **Sodium-Potassium Pump**:
  - Exchanges 3 Na⁺ out for 2 K⁺ in.
  - Maintains cell's membrane potential (voltage difference).
- **Electrogenic Pumps**:
  - Generate voltage.
  - Examples: Sodium-potassium pump (animals), Proton pump (plants, fungi, bacteria).

## **Concept 7.5**: Bulk Transport

- **Exocytosis**:
  - Vesicles fuse with the membrane to release contents.
- **Endocytosis**:
  - Membrane forms vesicles to bring materials inside.
  - Types:
    - **Phagocytosis**: Engulfs large particles.
    - **Pinocytosis**: Engulfs extracellular fluid.
    - **Receptor-mediated**: Specific ligands trigger vesicle formation.

## Membrane Proteins and Functions

- Types:
  - **Peripheral Proteins**: Bound to membrane surface.
  - **Integral Proteins**: Penetrate hydrophobic core; may span membrane (transmembrane proteins).
- **Functions**:
  - Transport.
  - Enzymatic activity.
  - Signal transduction.
  - Cell-cell recognition.
  - Intercellular joining.
  - Attachment to cytoskeleton and ECM.

## Summary Concepts

1. **Amphipathic molecules**: Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions (e.g., phospholipids).
2. **Membrane fluidity** influenced by:
   - Temperature.
   - Fatty acid saturation.
   - Cholesterol presence.
3. **Transport mechanisms**:
   - Passive: Diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion.
   - Active: Requires ATP.
4. **Electrogenic pumps** create voltage:
   - Sodium-potassium pump.
   - Proton pump.
5. **Bulk transport**: Exocytosis and endocytosis manage large molecules.
