## Stroma  
The [[Stroma]] is the fluid-filled space within the [[Chloroplast]] but outside the [[Thylakoid]] membranes. It is the site of the [[Calvin Cycle]], where [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]] produced in the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] are used to fix carbon dioxide into [[Glucose]]. The stroma also contains [[Enzymes]], DNA, and ribosomes, supporting [[Chloroplast]] function and protein synthesis. Its composition creates the ideal environment for the enzymatic reactions of [[Carbon Fixation]].
