### Anaerobic Respiration

*   When **oxygen is not available,** the anaerobic version of respiration occurs.
    
    *   The [[Electron Transport Chain]] stops working, and electron carriers have nowhere to drop their electrons.
        
    *   The mitochondrial production of acetyl- CoA and [[The Krebs Cycle]] cease too.
        
    *   [[Glycolysis]], however, can continue to run. This means that glucose can be broken down to give net two ATP. Only two instead of 30!
        
    *   [[Glycolysis]] also gives two pyruvates and two NADH. The pyruvate and NADH make a deal with each other, and pyruvate helps NADH get recycled back into NAD+ and takes its electrons.
        
    *   The pyruvate turns into either lactic acid (in muscles) or ethanol (in yeast).
	    
		- There is a byproduct of co2, which needs to be exhaled (ex. bubbles in beer)
        
    *   Since these two things are toxic at high concentrations, this process, called fermentation, is done only in emergencies. Aerobic respiration is a better option
        
*   What types of organisms undergo fermentation?
    
    *   Yeast cells and some bacteria make ethanol and carbon dioxide. Other bacteria produce lactic acid.
