## Enzymes  
[[Enzymes]] are specialized [[Catalysts]] that facilitate nearly all biochemical reactions in living organisms. By lowering the [[Activation Energy]] required, enzymes accelerate reactions that would otherwise proceed too slowly to sustain life. They work by stabilizing the [[Transition State]] of a reaction, allowing [[Substrates]] to convert into products more efficiently. Without enzymes, critical processes like [[Photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular Respiration]] would be impossible.
