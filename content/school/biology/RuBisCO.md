## RuBisCO  
[[RuBisCO]] (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) is the [[Enzyme]] responsible for fixing carbon dioxide in the [[Calvin Cycle]]. It catalyzes the reaction between CO2 and [[RuBP]], forming two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). Despite its essential role in [[Photosynthesis]], RuBisCO is relatively inefficient and prone to binding oxygen instead of CO2 in a process called [[Photorespiration]].
