## Stomata  
[[Stomata]] are small pores located on the surface of leaves that regulate gas exchange. They allow carbon dioxide to enter the plant for [[Photosynthesis]] and release [[Oxygen as a Byproduct]]. However, stomata also release water vapor through [[Transpiration]]. Their opening and closing are controlled by [[Guard Cells]], which respond to environmental conditions like light, humidity, and CO2 concentration.
