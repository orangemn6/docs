## Electromagnetic Spectrum  
The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all types of electromagnetic radiation, which differ in wavelength and energy. These waves include everything from long-wavelength radio waves to short-wavelength gamma rays, but for [[Photosynthesis]], the most relevant part of the spectrum is the visible light range.  

- **Wavelengths and Energy**: The spectrum ranges from long-wavelength, low-energy waves (like radio waves) to short-wavelength, high-energy waves (like gamma rays). Visible light, which is utilized by plants for photosynthesis, spans wavelengths from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).  

- **Visible Light and [[Photosynthesis]]**: Plants primarily absorb light from the blue (400-500 nm) and red (600-700 nm) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. [[Chlorophyll]] [[Pigments]], especially [[Chlorophyll a]] and [[chlorophyll b]], absorb these wavelengths most efficiently, facilitating the energy capture necessary for photosynthesis.  

- **Absorption Spectrum**: The absorption spectrum is a graph that shows how well a pigment absorbs light across different wavelengths. The pigments in plants have absorption peaks in the blue and red regions, while green light is largely reflected, giving plants their characteristic color.  

Understanding the electromagnetic spectrum is essential to understanding how plants capture [[energy]] from light and convert it into chemical energy through [[Photosynthesis]].
