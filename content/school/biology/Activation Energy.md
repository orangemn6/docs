## Activation Energy  
[[Activation Energy]] is the minimum amount of [[energy]] needed for a chemical reaction to occur. [[Enzymes]] lower this barrier, enabling reactions to happen more quickly and with less energy input. For example, during [[Photosynthesis]], [[Enzymes|Enzyme]] help split water molecules by reducing the activation energy required. This efficiency is essential for maintaining life processes under normal biological conditions.
