> *In biology, [[ATP]] is what is referred to whenever energy is mentioned.*

ATP stands for Adenosine Triphosphate, which is a **Nucleic Acid** that stores energy in the phosphate groups attached to the central sugar. When these bonds are broken, free energy is released to be used by the organism. 

[[ATP]] is created through the process of [[Cellular Respiration]], where the equation is:
$$
\mathrm{C}_{6}^{}\mathrm{H}_{12}^{}\mathrm{O}_{6}^{} + 6\mathrm{O}_{2}^{} \to 6\mathrm{H}_{2}^{}\mathrm{O}_{}^{} + 6\mathrm{C}_{}^{}\mathrm{O}_{2}^{} + ATP
$$
