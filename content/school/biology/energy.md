> *In biology, ATP is what is referred to whenever energy is mentioned.*

ATP stands for Adenosine Triphosphate, which is a **Nucleic Acid** that stores energy in the phosphate groups attached to the central sugar. When these bonds are broken, free energy is released to be used by the organism. 

ATP is created through the process of cellular respiration, where the equation is:
$$
\[
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 6\text{CO}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Energy (ATP)}
\]
$$
