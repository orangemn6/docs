## NADP+ and NADPH  
[[NADP+]] (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is a coenzyme that serves as an electron carrier during the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]]. It is reduced to [[NADPH]] at the end of the [[Electron Transport Chain]] in [[Photosystem I]]. [[NADPH]] is then used as a reducing agent in the [[Calvin Cycle]], providing the high-[[energy]] electrons necessary for converting CO2 into [[Glucose]].
