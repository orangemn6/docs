### Electron Transport Chain

*   As electrons are removed from a molecule of [[Glucose]], they carry much [[energy]] that was originally stored in their chemical bonds.
    
*   These electrons are transferred to readied hydrogen carrier molecules.
    
*   In the case of [[Cellular Respiration]], these charged carriers are the coenzymes NADH and FADH2.
    
*   We now have:
    
    *   2 NADH molecules from [[Glycolysis]]
        
    *   2 NADH from the production of acetyl-CoA
        
    *   6 NADH from [[The Krebs Cycle]]
        
    *   2 FADH2 from [[The Krebs Cycle]]
        
*   That gives us a total of 12 electron or [[energy]] carriers altogether.
    
*   These electron carriers—**NADH and FADH2—“shuttle”** electrons to the electron transport chain, the resulting NAD+ and FADH can be recycled to be used as carriers again, and the hydrogen atoms are split into hydrogen ions and electrons.
    
*   The high-[[energy]] electrons from NADH and FADH2 are passed down a series of protein carrier molecules that are embedded in the cristae; thus, it is called the electron transport chain.
    
*   Some of the carrier molecules in the electron transport chain are NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome C.
    
*   Each carrier molecule hands down the electrons to the next molecule in the chain.
    
*   The electrons travel down the electron transport chain until they reach the final electron acceptor, oxygen. Oxygen combines with these electrons (and some hydrogens) to form water.
    
*   This explains the “aerobic” in [[aerobic respiration]]. If oxygen weren’t available to accept the electrons, they wouldn’t move down the chain at all, thereby shutting down the whole process of electron transport.## Electron Transport Chain  
The [[Electron Transport Chain]] (ETC) is a series of proteins embedded in the [[Thylakoid]] membrane that transfer electrons during the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]]. As electrons move through the chain, [[energy]] is released and used to pump protons from the [[Stroma]] into the [[Thylakoid Lumen]], creating a [[Proton Gradient]]. Key components include [[Plastoquinone]] (PQ), the [[Cytochrome Complex]], and [[Plastocyanin]] (PC). The ETC links [[Photosystem II]] to [[Photosystem I]], enabling [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]] production for the [[Calvin Cycle]].
