## Photosynthesis  
[[Photosynthesis]] is the process by which autotrophic organisms, such as plants, algae, and some bacteria, convert light [[energy]] into chemical energy stored in [[Glucose]]. The overall reaction is represented as:  
\[ 6CO_2 + 6H_2O \xrightarrow{\text{light}} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \]  
This process occurs in two main stages: the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] and the [[Calvin Cycle]]. Photosynthesis not only provides energy for the organism performing it but also produces oxygen, which is essential for most life on Earth.
