## Structure of a Leaf  
The structure of a leaf is optimized for its primary function: [[Photosynthesis]]. Leaves are typically thin, broad, and flat, maximizing surface area to capture sunlight efficiently. The major components of a leaf include:  

- **[[Epidermis]]**: The outermost cell layer that protects the leaf. It consists of an upper and lower [[Epidermis]], often covered by a waxy [[Cuticle]] to reduce water loss.  
- **[[Stomata]]**: Pores in the [[Epidermis]], controlled by [[Guard Cells]], which regulate gas exchange and water vapor release. 
- **[[Mesophyll]]**: The middle layer of the leaf, divided into two regions:  
  - **Palisade [[Mesophyll]]**: Packed with chloroplasts, this layer is the primary site of [[Photosynthesis]].  
  - **Spongy [[Mesophyll]]**: Loosely arranged cells with air spaces to facilitate gas exchange.  
- **[[Veins]] (Vascular Bundles)**: Composed of xylem and phloem, [[Veins]] transport water, nutrients, and sugars. The xylem carries water and minerals from the roots, while the phloem distributes the sugars produced by photosynthesis.  

This arrangement ensures efficient absorption of light, exchange of gases, and distribution of nutrients, making the leaf a highly specialized organ for energy production.
