### Chemiosmosis

*   The [[energy]] released from the [[Electron Transport Chain]] is used to pump hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane from the matrix into the inter-membrane space.
    
*   The pumping of hydrogen ions into the inter-membrane space creates a pH gradient, or **proton gradient.**
    
*   The hydrogen ions really want to diffuse back into the matrix. The potential [[energy]] established in this gradient is responsible for the production of ATP.
    
*   This pumping of ions and diffusion of ions to create ATP is chemiosmosis
    
*   Overall, this process is called oxidative phosphorylation because when electrons are given up it is called “oxidation” and then ADP is “phosphorylated” to make ATP.
