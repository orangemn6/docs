### Chemiosmosis

*   The [[energy]] released from the [[Electron Transport Chain]] is used to pump hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane from the matrix into the inter-membrane space.
    
*   The pumping of hydrogen ions into the inter-membrane space creates a pH gradient, or **proton gradient.**
    
*   The hydrogen ions really want to diffuse back into the matrix. The potential [[energy]] established in this gradient is responsible for the production of ATP.
    
*   This pumping of ions and diffusion of ions to create ATP is chemiosmosis
    
*   Overall, this process is called oxidative [[Phosphorylation]] because when electrons are given up it is called “oxidation” and then ADP is “phosphorylated” to make ATP.

This is where ATP Synthase takes free electrons and uses them to recharge ADP into ATP through the flow of electrons
