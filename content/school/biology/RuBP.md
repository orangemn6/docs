## RuBP  
Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) is a five-carbon sugar phosphate molecule that plays a central role in the [[Calvin Cycle]] of [[Photosynthesis]]. It acts as the carbon dioxide acceptor, enabling the process of [[Carbon Fixation]] to begin.  

- **[[Carbon Fixation]]**: RuBP combines with carbon dioxide (CO2) in a reaction catalyzed by the [[Enzyme]] [[Rubisco]]. This reaction produces a highly unstable six-carbon intermediate, which quickly splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).  

- **[[Regeneration Phase of Calvin Cycle|regeneration]]**: During the final phase of the [[Calvin Cycle]], RuBP is regenerated from [[G3P]] molecules. This [[Regeneration Phase of Calvin Cycle|regeneration]] is critical to sustain the cycle, as RuBP must be available to continuously capture CO2 for [[Photosynthesis]].  

RuBP’s availability and the efficiency of its interaction with CO2 are crucial for the overall productivity of [[Photosynthesis]]. Environmental factors, such as CO2 concentration and temperature, can influence RuBP's efficiency by affecting [[RuBisCO]]’s activity, impacting the plant's ability to synthesize sugars.
