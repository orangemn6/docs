## Photosystem I  
[[Photosystem I]] (PSI) is a protein-pigment complex found in the [[Thylakoid]] membrane that absorbs light [[energy]], primarily at 700 nm wavelengths. It plays a crucial role in the second stage of the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]]. Electrons from [[Photosystem II]] are re-energized here and transferred to the protein ferredoxin. These electrons are ultimately used to reduce [[NADP+]]+ into [[NADPH]], which is necessary for the [[Calvin Cycle]].
