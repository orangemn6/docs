## C4 Plants  
[[C4 Plants]] have adapted to hot and dry environments by performing [[Carbon Fixation]] in a specialized way. They fix CO2 into a four-carbon compound in mesophyll cells, which is then transported to bundle-sheath cells for the [[Calvin Cycle]]. This spatial separation of processes reduces [[Photorespiration]] by maintaining high CO2 concentrations around [[RuBisCO]]. Examples of C4 plants include maize, sugarcane, and sorghum.
