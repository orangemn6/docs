## Mitochondria  
Mitochondria are double-membraned [[organelles-info-chart|organelles]] found in nearly all [[Eukaryotic Cells]], often referred to as the "powerhouses of the cell" due to their role in producing [[ATP]] through [[Cellular Respiration]]. The inner membrane is highly folded into structures called [[Cristae]], which increase surface area for the [[Electron Transport Chain]], a key stage of energy production. The matrix, the internal space within the mitochondria, contains [[Enzymes]] for  [[The Krebs Cycle]] and mitochondrial [[DNA]], which supports the [[Endosymbiotic Theory]] of their origin.  

Mitochondria are essential for energy metabolism, converting energy stored in [[Glucose]] and [[Lipids]] into usable chemical energy. 

The collaboration between mitochondria and [[Chloroplasts]] in plant cells demonstrates the interdependence of energy production and consumption in [[Autotrophs]] and [[Heterotrophs]].
