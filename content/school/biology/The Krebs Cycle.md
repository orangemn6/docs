### The Krebs Cycle

*   Also known as the **citric acid cycle.**
    
    *   The Krebs cycle begins with each molecule of acetyl-CoA produced from the second stage of [[Aerobic Respiration]] combining with oxaloacetate, a four-carbon molecule, to form a six-carbon molecule, citric acid or citrate.
        
    *   In the mitochondria, pyruvate is turned into acetyl- CoA and 1 NADH is made; double this if you are counting per [[Glucose]].
        
    *   The Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.
        
    *   It begins with acetyl-CoA joining with oxaloacetate to make citric acid and ends with oxaloacetate, 1 [[ATP]], 3 NADH, and 1 FADH2; double this if you are counting per [[Glucose]].
        
    *   Citrate gets turned into several other things, and because the cycle begins with a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, it eventually gets turned back into oxaloacetate to maintain the cycle by joining with the next acetyl-CoA coming down the pipeline.
        
*   With each turn of the cycle, three types of [[energy]] are produced:
    
    *   1 [[ATP]]
        
    *   3 NADH
        
    *   1 FADH2
        
*   To figure out the total number of products per molecule of [[Glucose]], we simply double the number of products.
