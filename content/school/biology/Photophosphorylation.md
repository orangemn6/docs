## Photophosphorylation  
Photophosphorylation is the process by which ATP is synthesized using the energy derived from light during the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] of [[Photosynthesis]]. It occurs within the [[Thylakoid]] membranes of [[Chloroplast]] and is driven by the transfer of electrons through the [[Electron Transport Chain]] (ETC). There are two types of photophosphorylation:  

- **Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation**:  
  - This is the primary pathway of photophosphorylation.  
  - It involves both [[Photosystem II]] (PSII) and [[Photosystem I]] (PSI).  
  - Light excites electrons in PSII, which are passed through the ETC, producing a [[Proton Gradient]] that powers ATP synthesis via ATP synthase. The electrons are then transferred to PSI and ultimately reduce [[NADP+]] to [[NADPH]].  
  - Water is split (photolysis) to replenish the electrons in PSII, releasing [[Oxygen as a Byproduct]].  

- **Cyclic Photophosphorylation**:  
  - This occurs only in PSI and recycles electrons within the ETC.  
  - Instead of reducing NADP+, the electrons return to PSI, generating additional [[ATP]] without producing NADPH or releasing oxygen.  
  - This pathway is used to balance the ATP and NADPH needs of the [[Calvin Cycle]].  

Photophosphorylation is essential for producing the ATP and NADPH required to drive the light-independent reactions, where [[Carbon Fixation]] occurs to synthesize [[G3P]] and eventually [[Glucose]].
