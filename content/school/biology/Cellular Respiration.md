Cellular Respiration
--------------------

*   C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP
    
*   You can break cellular respiration down into two different approaches:
    
*   [[aerobic respiration]] and [[Anaerobic Respiration]].
    
*   If ATP is made in the presence of oxygen, we call it [[aerobic respiration]]. If oxygenit isn’t present, we call it [[Anaerobic Respiration]].

Overarching term that includes [[Glycolysis]],  [[The Krebs Cycle]], and [[Electron Transport Chain]]
