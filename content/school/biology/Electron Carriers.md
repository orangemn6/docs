## Electron Carriers

**NADH and FADH2**

> [!info]  small organic molecules that play key roles in cellular respiration

Electrons from organic compounds are first transferred to NAD+, a **coenzyme**

As an electron acceptor, NAD+ acts as an oxidizing agent during cellular respiration  
For example in Cellular Respiration:

- Glucose loses electrons and becomes oxidized   
- NAD+ takes electrons and becomes NADH+  
- NADH+ carries electrons site of reaction to become ATP

NADH passes electrons to the electron transport chain
