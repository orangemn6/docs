## ATP Synthase  
[[ATP Synthase]] is an enzyme embedded in the [[Thylakoid]] membrane that synthesizes ATP during the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]]. It harnesses the [[energy]] from the [[Proton Gradient]] created by the [[Electron Transport Chain]]. As protons flow back into the [[Stroma]] from the [[Thylakoid Lumen]] through ATP Synthase, the enzyme catalyzes the [[Phosphorylation]] of ADP to form ATP. This ATP is then used in the [[Calvin Cycle]] to drive sugar synthesis.
