## Thermodynamics  
[[Thermodynamics]] governs how [[energy]] flows in biological systems, setting fundamental limits on what cells can accomplish. The [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] ensures that energy cannot be created or destroyed but must be obtained from external sources like light or chemical compounds. The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] highlights the natural tendency of systems toward [[Entropy]], or disorder, making energy input essential for maintaining order in cells. Together, these laws explain the delicate balance organisms must achieve to survive and thrive.
