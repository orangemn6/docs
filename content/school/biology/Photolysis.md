## Photolysis  
[[Photolysis]] is the process of splitting water molecules using light [[energy]], which occurs in [[Photosystem II]] during the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]]. This reaction produces electrons, protons, and oxygen as byproducts. The electrons replenish those lost by [[Photosystem II]], while the protons contribute to the [[Proton Gradient]] used to generate ATP. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a vital byproduct of [[Photosynthesis]].
