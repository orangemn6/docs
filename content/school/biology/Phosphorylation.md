There are two main types of phosphorylation in biological processes: substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation. Here’s a summary:

  

Substrate-Level Phosphorylation

• Definition: ATP is produced directly by the transfer of a phosphate group from a phosphorylated substrate to ADP.

• Process: This transfer is catalyzed by an [[Enzymes|Enzyme]].

• Location:

• Occurs in the cytoplasm during [[Glycolysis]].

• Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix during [[The Krebs Cycle]].

• [[energy]] Source: Does not require oxygen; instead, it relies on high-[[energy]] intermediates.

• Efficiency: Produces smaller amounts of ATP compared to oxidative phosphorylation.

• Examples:

• [[Glycolysis]]: Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) donates a phosphate to ADP, forming ATP.

• Krebs cycle: Succinyl-CoA donates a phosphate group to GDP (or ADP).

  

Oxidative Phosphorylation

• Definition: ATP is produced through the [[Electron Transport Chain]] (ETC) and [[Chemiosmosis]], using a [[Proton Gradient]] across a membrane.

• Process:

1. High-[[energy]] electrons from NADH and FADH₂ are transferred through a series of proteins in the ETC.

2. This movement powers the pumping of protons (H⁺) across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

3. Protons flow back into the matrix through [[ATP Synthase]], driving the synthesis of [[ATP]] from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi).

• Location: Inner mitochondrial membrane (eukaryotes) or plasma membrane (prokaryotes).

• [[energy]] Source: Requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor, forming water.

• Efficiency: Produces the majority of ATP in [[Cellular Respiration]] (~34 ATP per [[Glucose]] molecule).
