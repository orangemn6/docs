## Phosphorylation

Recharging of ADP into [[energy |ATP]]  
Exergonic reaction that drives many other cellular activities in living things

### Substrate-level phosphorylation

- Driven by enzymes  
- Substrate and ADP are turned into ATP  
- Moves phosphate from substrate onto ATP  
- Driven by Kinase enzyme  
- [[Anaerobic]]

### Oxidative Phosphorylation

- Electrons from NADH or FADH2 transferred from to O2
