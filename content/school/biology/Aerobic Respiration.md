### Introduction to Aerobic Respiration

Aerobic respiration consists of four stages containing a series of coupled reactions that establish an electrochemical gradient across membranes:

1.  [[Glycolysis]]
    
2.  [[Formation of Acetyl-CoA]]
    
3.  [[the Krebs cycle]]
    
4.  oxidative phosphorylation (the [[Electron Transport Chain]] + [[Chemiosmosis]])
