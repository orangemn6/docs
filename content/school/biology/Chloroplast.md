## Chloroplast  
The [[Chloroplast]] is the primary organelle where [[Photosynthesis]] occurs in plants and algae. It consists of several key structures: the outer membrane, inner membrane, [[Stroma]], and [[Thylakoid]] membranes. The [[Grana]] (stacks of thylakoids) contain [[Chlorophyll]] and other [[Pigments]] that absorb light for the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]]. Chloroplasts are believed to have originated from a symbiotic relationship between ancestral eukaryotic cells and photosynthetic prokaryotes, as explained by the [[Endosymbiotic Theory]].
