## Regeneration Phase of Calvin Cycle  
The regeneration phase of the [[Calvin Cycle]] ensures the continuous operation of the cycle by regenerating ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). This process uses [[ATP]] to rearrange and combine [[G3P]] molecules, forming RuBP. The cycle must complete three turns to produce one [[G3P]] molecule while maintaining enough RuBP for [[Carbon Fixation]] to continue.
