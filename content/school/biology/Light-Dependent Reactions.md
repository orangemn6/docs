## Light-Dependent Reactions  
The [[Light-Dependent Reactions]] occur in the [[Thylakoid]] membranes and require light to produce [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]]. When photons strike [[Chlorophyll]] molecules in [[Photosystem II]], electrons are excited and passed through the [[Electron Transport Chain]], generating a [[Proton Gradient]]. This gradient powers [[ATP Synthase]] to produce ATP. Electrons are then passed to [[Photosystem I]], where they are re-energized and used to reduce [[NADP+]] into [[NADPH]]. The splitting of water, or [[Photolysis]], replenishes lost electrons in [[Photosystem II]] and releases [[Oxygen as a Byproduct]].
