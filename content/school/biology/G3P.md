## G3P  
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (**G3P**) is a three-carbon sugar produced during the [[Calvin Cycle]] in the [[Stroma]] of the [[Chloroplast]]. It is a key intermediate in [[Photosynthesis]], serving as the primary product of [[carbon fixation]]. Two molecules of G3P are eventually used to synthesize one molecule of [[glucose]] or other organic compounds, making it a critical building block for plant metabolism.  

G3P is formed when [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]], generated in the [[Light-Dependent Reactions]], provide the energy and electrons needed to reduce 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) during the Calvin Cycle. Some G3P is recycled to regenerate [[RuBP]], enabling the cycle to continue, while the rest exits the cycle to contribute to carbohydrate synthesis. Its versatility makes G3P an essential molecule for energy storage and biosynthesis in plants.
