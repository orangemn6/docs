### Formation of Acetyl-CoA

*   Pyruvic acid is **transported to the mitochondrion.**
    
*   Each pyruvic acid (a three-carbon molecule) is converted to acetyl-coenzyme
    
*   A (a two-carbon molecule, usually just called acetyl-CoA) and CO2 is released.
    
*   2 Pyruvic acid + 2 Coenzyme A + 2NAD+ â†’ 2 Acetyl-CoA + 2CO2 + 2NADH
    
*   From two 3- carbon molecules to now two 2-carbon molecules.
    
*   The extra carbons leave the cell in the form of CO2. Once again, two molecules of NADH are also produced for each glucose you started with.
    
*   This process of turning pyruvic acid into acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by an enzyme complex called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).
