## Enzyme Specificity  
[[Enzyme Specificity]] refers to the unique ability of an enzyme to catalyze only one specific reaction. This specificity arises from the precise shape of the [[Active Site]], which matches only certain [[Substrates]]. For example, the enzyme [[Rubisco]] specifically catalyzes a key step in the [[Calvin Cycle]] during [[Photosynthesis]]. This property ensures that [[Enzymes]] facilitate reactions with precision and efficiency.
