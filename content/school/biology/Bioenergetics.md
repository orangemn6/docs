## Bioenergetics  
[[Bioenergetics]] is the study of how cells acquire, convert, and utilize [[energy]] to perform biological processes. It includes key concepts like [[Photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular Respiration]], which are crucial for sustaining life. These processes involve [[energy]] transformations and coupling between [[Exergonic Reactions]] and [[Endergonic Reactions]] to maintain order in living systems. By understanding bioenergetics, we can explore how organisms manage energy efficiently and adapt to environmental changes.
