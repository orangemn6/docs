## Veins  
Veins in plants, also known as vascular bundles, are integral components of leaves that provide structural support and transport essential substances. They consist of two main tissues:  

- **Xylem**: Responsible for transporting water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant, including the leaves. This movement is driven by [[Transpiration]] and root pressure.  
- **Phloem**: Transports sugars and other organic compounds produced during [[Photosynthesis]] from the leaves to other parts of the plant for [[energy]] storage and use.  

Veins are typically arranged in patterns characteristic of plant groups. In monocots, veins run parallel, while in dicots, they form a branching network. The vascular tissues are surrounded by a bundle sheath, a layer of protective cells that also play a role in regulating the movement of substances.  

The placement of veins ensures efficient distribution of nutrients and water throughout the leaf, supporting cellular activities and maintaining overall plant health.
