**Prompt for ChatGPT:**

"I am creating atomic notes for an Obsidian vault. Each note should be formatted as a Markdown file with the following rules:

1. Use a single H2 heading (`##`) as the title of the note.
2. Provide 3–4 detailed sentences explaining the topic in a way that connects to related concepts. Expand with additional context if relevant.
3. Include wikilinks (`[[ ]]`) to related topics, ensuring interconnectedness between notes.
4. Focus on depth and clarity, avoiding overly simplified explanations. The content should be useful for studying complex topics like biology or photosynthesis.
5. Assume each note is part of a larger system, and build content to integrate with related atomic notes.

Example Topic: Photosynthesis

Output:

```markdown
## Photosynthesis  
Photosynthesis is the biological process by which [[Autotrophs]] convert light energy into chemical energy, producing [[Glucose]] and [[Oxygen]] as primary products. This process occurs in the [[Chloroplasts]] of plant cells, particularly within the [[Thylakoid Membrane]] and [[Stroma]]. Photosynthesis consists of two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the [[Calvin Cycle]] (light-independent reactions). During the light-dependent reactions, [[Photosystem II]] and [[Photosystem I]] work together to produce [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]], which fuel the carbon fixation in the Calvin Cycle.  

The overall equation of photosynthesis is:  
6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2  

Photosynthesis is vital for life on Earth, as it forms the foundation of most food webs and contributes to the [[Oxygen Cycle]].
