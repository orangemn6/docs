### TL;DR

ChatGPT is a very useful tool leveraging LLMs to intake data and give you results you need. In my opinion, it is an amazing development both for education and productivity, even though it has a dishonest connotation in most academic settings. I use it for my notes for [[school/index.md |school]], and it has proven to be a very good way to save time and energy, while still achieving academic results.
