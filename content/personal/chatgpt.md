### TL;DR

ChatGPT is a very useful tool leveraging LLMs to intake data and give you results you need. In my opinion, it is an amazing development both for education and productivity, even though it has a dishonest connotation in most academic settings. I use it for my notes for [[school/index.md |school]], and it has proven to be a very good way to save time and energy, while still achieving academic results. 

## Workflow
  
My main workflow when using chatgpt for notes is turning my handwritten notes into markdown. During class, I write down main details in my notebook to minimize distractions. 

After [[school/index|school]], I upload scans of all of my notes into ChatGPT and ask for formatted markdown **without changing the content**. ChatGPT tends to shrink the content in order to save tokens, which isnâ€™t an issue if you use multiple chats.
