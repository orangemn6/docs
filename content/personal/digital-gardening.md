## What is digital gardening?

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public.

### My Usage

I have made many attempts at creating a blog or [[personal]] website in the past, and that has not always worked out because of my lack of motivation to create content. Like others, I also fall into the productivity rabbit hole of trying and using new, different note taking or second brain tools every week.

Another dillema I face constantly is taking good notes during [[school]. By creating this digital garden, I can hold myself accountable to taking good, studyable notes during class.

I will constantly be returning to this page and linking to it whenever I am discussing digital gardening.
