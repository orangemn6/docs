## Overview

Taking notes is a large part of being a student. An essential part of academics is being able to remember and retain information. This outlines my general methodology for taking notes inside and outside of school.

## In [[School]]

All of my notes are organized in this vault by class. I have a system of topic and class tags that further connect my notes. There are 2 types of notes: unit notes and unit study guides. Unit notes contain information that is said in class, and is how I directly put content into the vault. I have one separate document for each unit, unless it is split into parts. Unit study guides, on the other hand, are processed into studyable material. Creating study guide notes are in their own way an actionable method of studying. 

Many notes that I take are on paper, and are later [[personal/chatgpt.md |post-processed]].

## For [[Personal]]

My personal notes are mostly writings about my productivity or collections of things I find on the internet. I aim to keep an obsidian-compliant notebook with linked notes and tags. The [personal/resources.md]] page is where I dump limks I need to look at later. If I am reading an article and something stands out to me, I may make a new note with my thoughts.
