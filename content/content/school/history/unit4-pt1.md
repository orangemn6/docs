# Revolutionary War 

## British Strategy and Challenges
- **City Captures**: The British had little trouble capturing cities since most were on the coast, allowing the British navy to provide support.
- **Challenges**:
  - Did not want to kill their colonial subjects.
  - Burdened by heavy debt from the French and Indian War.
  - Economic impact from colonial non-importation agreements made the war effort costly.

## Battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775)
- **Setup**:
  - Colonists surrounded Boston and occupied the high ground of **Breed’s Hill** and **Bunker Hill** on the north Charlestown Peninsula.
- **Key Details**:
  - The British launched a costly frontal assault but ultimately took the hill.
  - Though a tactical victory for the British, it demonstrated that the colonists could put up a strong fight.
